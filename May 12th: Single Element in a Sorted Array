You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. 
Find this single element that appears only once.


class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int x=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length/2;i+=2){
            if (nums[i]!=nums[i+1]){
                x=nums[i];
                break;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
}
